A note on resolving poster paths with themoviedb.org API

You will notice that the API response provides a relative path to a movie poster image when you request the metadata for a specific movie.

For example, the poster path return for Interstellar is “/nBNZadXqJSdt05SHLqgT0HuC5Gm.jpg”

You will need to append a base path ahead of this relative path to build the complete url you will need to fetch the image using Picasso.

It’s constructed using 3 parts:

    The base URL will look like: http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/.
    Then you will need a ‘size’, which will be one of the following: "w92", "w154", "w185", "w342", "w500", "w780", or "original". For most phones we recommend using “w185”.
    And finally the poster path returned by the query, in this case “/nBNZadXqJSdt05SHLqgT0HuC5Gm.jpg”

Combining these three parts gives us a final url of http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185//nBNZadXqJSdt05SHLqgT0HuC5Gm.jpg



This is also explained explicitly in the API documentation for /configuration.
